Collection of materials related to IBM z/OS security

The goal is to collect all basic materials currently scattered over blogs, tumblrs, pastebins, etc. into one (easily distributable) repository where they can also be improved with community effort. Join the work, open some pull requests!

There is a Wiki too!

Under Construction :)
